import React from "react";

export default () => {
  return (
    <div className="block">
      <h1>The Light Bulb</h1>
      Your goal: switch the lightbulb on
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          In this component (turn it into a class, or leave it as a function),
          create a state that will keep track of whether the lightbulb is turned
          on or not
        </li>
        <li>
          Put an onClick handler on the <strong>turn me on</strong> button that
          will change the lightbulb's state from on to off
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the state as a toggler, conditionaly change the className of the
          lightbulb's holding div from <em>"block"</em> to{" "}
          <em>"block night"</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Let's think about the planet and not be wasteful. Make sure that the
          lightbulb turns itself off after 5 seconds :)
        </li>
        <li>
          Using another state, keep track of how many times the light bulb has
          been turned on. After 10 times, tell the user he used his daily
          electricity limit and should light a candle instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
